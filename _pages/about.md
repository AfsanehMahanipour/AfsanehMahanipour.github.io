## Hi,

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science](https://engr.uky.edu/academics/departments/cs) at the University of Kentucky, working under the supervision of [Dr. Hana Khamfroush](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qNAcUB8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and distributed systems, with a particular focus on generative AI, federated learning, edge AI, and multimodal models. I aim to design scalable, distributed intelligent systems that leverage data-driven strategies to optimize performance and adaptability. My work emphasizes fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to advance communication, computation, Quality of Service (QoS), and decision-making in resource-constrained environments. These efforts address critical challenges in domains such as smart healthcare, intelligent transportation, industrial automation, and smart cities, where efficient and reliable AI solutions are essential for real-world impact.



## Research Interests:
- Edge AI
- Federated Learning
- Generative AI
- Multimodal Data Analysis
